        <h2>About Senegal</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            Senegal is a country in West Africa, on the Atlantic Ocean coastline. Senegal is bordered 
            by Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast and Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. 
            Senegal nearly surrounds the Gambia, a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia
            River, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a 
            maritime border with Cape Verde. Senegal's economic and political capital is Dakar.

        <h2>The Culture</h2>
        <p>
            Senegal is well known for the West African tradition of storytelling, which is done by griots, who have kept West African 
            history alive for thousands of years through words and music. The griot profession is passed down generation to generation 
            and requires years of training and apprenticeship in genealogy, history and music. Griots give voice to generations of West 
            African society.

        <h2>The Cuisine</h2>
        <p>
            Because Senegal borders the Atlantic Ocean, fish is very important. Chicken, lamb, peas, eggs, and beef are also used in Senegalese cooking, 
            but not pork, due to the nation's largely Muslim population. Peanuts, the primary crop of Senegal, as well as couscous, white rice, sweet potatoes, 
            lentils, black-eyed peas and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes. Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs 
            and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.

        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>
            Senegal has a wide variety of ethnic groups and, as in most West African countries, several languages are widely spoken. The Wolof are the largest ethnic group in Senegal,
            the Fula and Toucouleur are the second biggest group, followed by the Serer, then others such as Jola, Mandinka, Maures, Soninke, Bassari and many smaller communities.
